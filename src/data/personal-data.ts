    "Transitioned from **Biomedical Engineer** to **Senior Business Analyst** in under a year, demonstrating rapid learning and adaptability in a new field. Starting with a strong foundation in biomedical engineering, I quickly applied my analytical and problem-solving skills to business analysis, where I have successfully driven key projects. Most notably, I led the development of a **comprehensive ERP system** for a company within the **Laguna group**, integrating complex systems to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.
